# Sudoku Solver Visualizer
A web application to visualize sudoku solving using backtracking. I created this visualization tool to see the backtracking algorithm in action. I hope this may help a few people out there understand how backtracking works!

## To Do
* Add styling to the app to make it more appealing
* Implement functionality for the user to be able to fill the sudoku cells
* Implement functionality to generate sudokus

## Acknowledgments
* I was greatly inspired by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g) and his awesome pathfinder visualizer tool! You can check it [here](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer)

# Sudoku Solver Visualizer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nibble-4bits/Sudoku-Solver-Visualizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nibble-4bits/Sudoku-Solver-Visualizer)

A web application to visualize sudoku solving using backtracking. I created this visualization tool to see the backtracking algorithm in action. I hope this may help a few people out there understand how backtracking works!
